          <h3>Gresik, East Java, Indonesia.</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Gresik is a regency in East Java province. It is bordered by
            Surabaya and the Madura Strait to the east, Lamongan to the west, the
            Java Sea to the north, Sidoarjo and Mojokerto to the south. Gresik
            also includes Bawean Island, which is 150 km off the Java Sea.
            <br><br>
            Gresik is known as the city where the first and largest cement company
            in Indonesia was founded, namely Semen Gresik. The name Gresik came
            from the word giri gisik, which means mountain on the shore, referring
            to the topography of Gresik which is located on the shore. The Gresik
            Government Center is located in Gresik District.
            <br><br>
            Most of the Gresik area is a coastal area, which extends from Kebomas,
            Gresik, Manyar, Bungah, Sidayu, Ujung Pangkah and Panceng Districts,
            as well as Sangkapura and Tambak Districts, which are located on Bawean
            Island. Most of the soil types in Gresik are relatively barren limestone.
            <br><br>
            Gresik is famous as the City of Walisongo, this is marked by historical
            exploration of the role and existence of the Walis whose graves are
            in Gresik, namely, Sunan Giri and Syekh Maulana Malik Ibrahim.</p>

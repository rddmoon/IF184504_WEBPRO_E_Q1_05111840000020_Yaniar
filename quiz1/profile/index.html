          <h3>Hello :)</h3>
          <p>I'm Yaniar Pradityas Effendi. I'm a 20-year-old college student. I'm
          in my third year of studies towards a bachelor's in Informatics at Institut
          Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Surabaya, Indonesia.
          <br><br>
          I was born in Gresik, East Java, Indonesia, and have been living there
          up until now. My MBTI personality type result is INTJ-A, not
          too accurate to describe me, though. Some people described me as a kind of
          quiet and reserved person, but my best friends stated otherwise. Some others
          described me as a diligent and serious type of a student. I can't help but
          laugh at that statement. I'm like, the most laid-back a person can be haha.
          My friends described me as a werd/unique/one of a kind/unsual person, because
          in most situations I would react differently.
          <br><br>
          I won't think too much about many things, it would just be a simple yes or no,
          or whether I like it or not. Mostly, I depend on my intuitions and be as
          realistic as I could. If you ask, does it work living like that?, you see,
          after about 20 years of my life, it works great for me.
          I won't describe the smallest details about myself, I will just write
          anything that I like. My life's pretty normal, though. I live my life in
          my own unique way. I'm really enjoying my life and just go with the flow.
          I guess you could say that I'm really grateful.
          <br><br>
          I love to take random photos, read,
          eat chocolates, and draw in my free time. There's this book series that
          I like and have been following since I was in elementary school, titled
          "Ulysses Moore" by the author Pierdomenico Baccalario, it's my favourite,
          but it's still ongoing. I also like reading some classics such as "Crime
          and Punishment", "Demian", "The Scarlet Letter", and etc. You see, it's
          mostly fiction books, but I also fancy some intriguing astronomy books,
          Carl Sagan's "Cosmos" and "Contact" are my favourites. It makes me reflect
          upon my life and understand how the universe works.
          <br><br>
          Yup. That's all about me. May you have a great day!

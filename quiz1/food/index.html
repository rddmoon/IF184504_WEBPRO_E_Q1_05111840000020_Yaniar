          <h2>1. Nasi Krawu</h2>
          <br>
          <p> One of the local foods of Gresik City that is very well known.
          Nasi krawu is one of the most popular culinary delights among the Gresik people.
          Its is usually served on a banana leaf.
          The warm fluffier rice served with stewed beef, sliced beef, beef offal and chili paste.
          This dish appearance is indeed simple but the taste and aroma is very tempting.
          <br><br>
          What's the difference between ordinary nasi krawu  and Gresik nasi krawu?
          Of course it's different because Gresik nasi krawu is made from a special recipe.
          Nasi krawu consists of rice, chili paste, shredded meat (be it chicken or
          beef, but mostly beef), serundeng, and belacan. You can also add side dishes
          such as tofu, eel, tripe, intestines, fried lungs, and beef intestine stew.
          Gresik nasi krawu can be considered more special because it has more menu options.</p>
